# Cooperation and Funding

This application was developed with the financial aid of the Uniqa foundation
by Accenture Austria.  It was Open Sourced by the Red Cross.  If you are a
government or organization interested in joining forces, please reach out to
Hasler Patrick <Patrick.Hasler@roteskreuz.at>.

If you see value in the source code and you want to use it for your own
efforts, **please consider a donation to the Austrian Red Cross and contact Gerry
Foitik, Federal Commander in Charge, Austrian National Red Cross Organization
and member of the crises management team of the Government in Austria**.

## Organizations and Governments

If you represent an organization or government we, the Red Cross, can offer you
to joining forces directly.  We built this application not just for ourselves
but with the hope that other organizations can benefit from it as well.  We're in
the unique situation that the Austrian app based contact tracing is run by an
independent organization (The Red Cross) and the application was built with this
in mind.

If you want to work together with us on this, we can give you access to an
internal issue tracker for early notification on issues reported via responsible
disclosure and other information that cannot be disclosed immediately.  We can
also provide you with our expertise in how we deployed it.

For more information please reach out directly to Hasler Patrick
<Patrick.Hasler@roteskreuz.at>.

## Individual Contributions

If you are an individual you can support the project in two ways: you can help
the development by sending pull requests or interact with us in the issue tracker.

You can also provide an individual financial contribution to the Austrian Red
Cross: [Donate](https://www.roteskreuz.at/mitmachen/spenden/).

We welcome all pull requests but reserve the right not to merge them if we
believe they are out of scope for the project.
